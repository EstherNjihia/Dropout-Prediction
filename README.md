# Dropout Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict student dropout rates using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains student-related features, and the model is designed to identify students at risk of dropping out.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand key dropout factors
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values and encode categorical variables
- **Machine Learning Model:** Train and evaluate a model for dropout prediction

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** - Data processing
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine Learning
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** - Visualization

## Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EstherNjihia/Dropout-Prediction.git
